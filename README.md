# Mars Rover Kata

This project is an implementation of the Mars Rover Kata in TypeScript. It allows users to enter input via the console to create a plateau, add rovers, and issue movement instructions to the rovers.

## Installation

To install this project, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

To run this project, use the `npm start` command. This will start the program and prompt you for input.

Enter the size of the plateau as two numbers separated by a space, such as `5 5`. Then enter the starting position and direction of a rover as two numbers and a letter separated by spaces, such as `1 2 N`. Finally, enter the movement instructions for the rover as a string of letters, such as `LMLMLMLMM`.

The program will process your input and output the final position and direction of the rover. You can enter additional rovers by following the same steps.

## Features

This project includes several features, such as collision detection between rovers and the ability to enter multiple rovers. 

## Issues

For future development need to embelish each Rover to have a name and functions/sensors that allow pictures to be taken for example.

## Output expected for:

 5 5
 1 2 N
 LMLMLMLMM
 3 3 E
 MMRMMRMRRM

 1 3 N
 5 1 E
